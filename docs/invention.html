                    <p>On October 4th, 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a satellite which relayed blips and bleeps from its radio transmitters as it circled the Earth. 
                      To catch up and hopefully surpass the Soviets in space technology, President Eisenhower created the bureau at the Defense Department called ARPA the 
                      Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was in charge of the space program which then included computer science. Computer communication was in the embryonic 
                      stage but it was making progress. At MIT a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock began applying queueing theory to data transmission.</p>

              <div class="part">
                    <h3 style="color: #FFD900">2. ARPAnet</h3>
                    <p>The seminal idea of the internet was envisioned by a psychologist, scientist and professor at MIT named Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider. 
                      In the 1950s, Licklider’s vision was that connecting all of the computers together would allow you to communicate and share information better. 
                      Computer communication was a flight of imagination far beyond anything at the movies. In the 1960s, America needed an indestructible communications 
                      network in the preparation of the Cold War. Paul Baran was hired to see if one could be built.
                </p>
                <p> In 1966, Bob Taylor of ARPA needed a separate terminal to log into each of several time shared computers at research centers across the country. 
                  Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for the job. Roberts had built the world's first experimental connection between two computers at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
                  in Lexington, Massachusetts. 1968 also was the year Larry Roberts sought out the engineers to build the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s computer network 
                  called the ARPANET. It was going to be based on special-purpose mini computers called Interface Message Processors or IMPs and packet switching. On September 
                  1st 1969 the first piece of hardware created for the computer network that was the forerunner of the internet arrived at UCLA. by the end of 1969 all four 
                  sites were interconnected. In April 1971, the ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #FFD900">3. The invention of electrical mailing application</h3>
                    <p>At first, there wasn't much to do on the ARPANET beyond transferring data files among its members but then a new capability was added the first killer 
                      application that would bring in the masses and take the usefulness of computer networking to a new level that killer app was email. Raymond Tomlinson was 
                      working on a mail program but it was programmed for a single computer so that you can send emails to yourself or other users on the sharing computer. He 
                      realized that the mailbox he was sending these emails to was a file and tried to send that file across the network instead of keeping it within the same 
                      machine. He modified the code and the first email program was created.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #FFD900">4. The TCP/IP Protocol</h3>
                    <p>In 1973, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules or procedures known as the TCP/IP protocol which if followed by different computer
                      networks would allow them to pass their message packets back and forth. The TCP/IP protocol enabled the networks to interconnect. Cerf and Kahn called the 
                      computer in the network that would know the protocol and thus be able to communicate across networks the Gateway. In 1983, after ten years of refinement 
                      and bureaucratic haggling TCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard marking a milestone in the development of the Internet, a common network of 
                      interconnected networks.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #FFD900">5. The World Wide Web</h3>
                    <p>In 1991, the internet changed again. That year, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet 
                      that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve. 
                      Berners-Lee created the Internet that we know today.
                </p>
                <p> In 1993, a group of students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. (It later became 
                  Netscape.) Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to 
                  navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.</p>
